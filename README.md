This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline setup for automating software development, testing, and deployment. The pipeline ensures faster and more reliable software delivery by integrating Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) principles.

What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI): Automates code integration, builds, and testing whenever new changes are pushed to the repository.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Automates the release and deployment process, ensuring smooth and consistent delivery to production environments.


Pipeline Stages

1. Source Code Management - Uses Git for version control (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).


2. Build - Compiles the code and resolves dependencies.


3. Test - Runs unit, integration, and security tests.


4. Deploy - Deploys the application to a staging or production environment.


5. Monitor & Logging - Tracks performance and errors using monitoring tools.



Tools Used

CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI

Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, Ansible

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
